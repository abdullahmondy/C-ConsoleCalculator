# [CSharpConsoleCalculator]

## 🚀 Overview

[Your Chosen Project Name] is a user-friendly, console-based calculator application meticulously crafted in C#. It empowers users to effortlessly perform fundamental arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A standout feature is its persistent session-based history, allowing users to review all calculations made, complete with operands, the operation performed, the result, and a precise timestamp.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of:
*   Core C# programming concepts and syntax.
*   Effective Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design, with a clear separation between the calculation logic (`CalculatorLogic`) and the user interface (`CalculatorInterface`).
*   Robust user input handling, including comprehensive validation routines.
*   Graceful error management for scenarios like division by zero or invalid input formats.
*   Utilizing C# collections for dynamic data storage (e.g., managing the calculation history).
*   Building an intuitive and interactive command-line interface (CLI) experience.

## ✨ Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
*   **Detailed Calculation History:** Access a chronological log of all operations performed during the session. Each entry includes:
    *   Timestamp
    *   First Operand
    *   Operation Symbol
    *   Second Operand
    *   Calculated Result
*   **Interactive Menu:** Simple and clear menu for navigating between performing calculations and viewing history.
*   **Input Validation:** Ensures that user inputs for numbers and operation symbols are valid before processing.
*   **Error Handling:** Politely informs the user about errors (e.g., "Cannot divide by zero," "Invalid input") without crashing.
*   **Clear Output:** Presents calculations and results in an easy-to-read format.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Language:** C#
*   **Platform:** .NET ([Specify your target .NET version, e.g., .NET 8, .NET 6, .NET Framework 4.7.2])
*   **Application Type:** Console Application

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL of your GitHub repository]
    cd [Your-Chosen-Project-Name]
    ```
2.  **Open in IDE:**
    *   Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
    *   Alternatively, open the project folder in an IDE like VS Code (ensure you have the C# Dev Kit extension).
3.  **Build the Project:**
    *   In Visual Studio: Build > Build Solution (or `Ctrl+Shift+B`).
    *   From the command line (if .NET Core/5+): `dotnet build`
4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   In Visual Studio: Debug > Start Debugging (or `F5`) or Start Without Debugging (`Ctrl+F5`).
    *   From the command line (if .NET Core/5+): `dotnet run`

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

This project was initially developed as [e.g., "a learning exercise to solidify C# fundamentals," "a practical tool for quick calculations," "a demonstration of OOP principles in a console environment"]. It aims to provide a clean, well-structured example of a C# console application that is both functional and easy to understand.

It's a great starting point for anyone looking to:
*   Learn basic C# programming.
*   Understand how to structure a small application.
*   See examples of input/output handling in a console environment.

## 💡 Potential Future Enhancements (Optional - but good to show vision)

*   [ ] Support for more advanced operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
*   [ ] Ability to save/load history to a file.
*   [ ] Implementation of unit tests.
*   [ ] Refactoring to use more advanced C# features or design patterns.
